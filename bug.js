This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.deviceId` API in a React Native application.  The `deviceId` sometimes returns `null` unexpectedly, even when the app has the necessary permissions and the device is not in a state that should prevent it from being retrieved. This inconsistency makes it difficult to reliably identify devices for analytics or other purposes that require unique device identifiers.
