# Expo Constants.deviceId Returns Null Inconsistently

This repository demonstrates a bug where `Constants.deviceId` in Expo returns `null` unexpectedly.  The issue is intermittent and doesn't follow an easily identifiable pattern.  The provided code attempts to retrieve the device ID and logs the result.  Inconsistent results (sometimes null, sometimes a valid ID) indicate the problem.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the application on a physical device or emulator.
4. Observe the console output.  You should see `null` in some runs and a valid device ID in others. The frequency of the `null` return seems to vary between devices and runs.

## Potential Causes

The root cause is currently unknown, but it's suspected to be related to either asynchronous operations in Expo's internal device ID retrieval process or occasional failures in retrieving the ID from the underlying system.

## Proposed Solution (bugSolution.js)

The solution involves implementing retries with exponential backoff to handle the intermittent failures.  The code will attempt to retrieve the device ID multiple times with increasing delays before giving up and potentially using a fallback mechanism.
